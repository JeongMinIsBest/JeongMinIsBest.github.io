## 🏥 RecomMomd: AI-based Maternity Hospital Matching System in Chungbuk
*Team Project | Jun 2025*
<br/>

- Tackled the **low birth rate problem** and **lack of maternity hospital accessibility** in Chungbuk Province.  
- Built a **hospital recommendation pipeline** integrating structured healthcare datasets (delivery success rates, C-section ratios, NICU availability) with unstructured review data (Naver blogs, maps).  
- Implemented **KoBERT-based sentiment analysis** to classify hospital reviews and highlight features valued by expectant mothers.  
- Applied **TF-IDF and LDA** to extract keywords and discover latent themes in hospital choice motivations.  
- Automated data collection via **Selenium + BeautifulSoup** and built a **ranking algorithm** combining user preferences (e.g., natural birth, proximity, female doctors) with hospital-level indicators.  
- Proposed deployment as a **mobile application** with an interactive **React frontend** for search and visualization.  
- Highlighted **policy-level implications**, enabling data-driven maternal healthcare planning and boosting trust in local hospitals.
