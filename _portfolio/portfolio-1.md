## 🌱 Credit Evaluation Alternative Model for Low-credit Small Business Owners, Utilizing Lifestyle-based ESG Quantitative Indicators
*Team Project | Jun 2025 – Aug 2025*  
<Br/>

- Developed an **alternative credit scoring model** incorporating **everyday ESG practices** (e.g., electricity usage, local product sales, electronic receipts, waste reduction) to address financial blind spots of micro-enterprises.  
- Designed a **multi-dimensional scoring framework** (E: 30%, S: 25%, G: 25%, Special ESG: 20%) balancing fairness and sector-specific characteristics.  
- Built data pipelines with **Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn**, integrating **public datasets, MyData APIs, and business records**.  
- Applied **ensemble learning (XGBoost, CatBoost)** to predict creditworthiness, and used **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to ensure model interpretability and fairness.  
- Proposed **policy adoption strategies** for regional banks, linking ESG practice data with financial services to expand financial accessibility.  
- Selected as a **National Finalist & Awardee** in the **2025 FIN:NECT Challenge**, recognized for technical innovation and policy applicability.
