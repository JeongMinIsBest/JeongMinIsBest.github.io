## 🏙️ Clustering Analysis of Solitary Death Risk among Single-Person Households in Seoul, Korea
*Team Project for 2025 Seoul Data Hub Visualization Competition | Aug 2025*  
<br/>

- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using open datasets from the **Seoul Open Data Hub**, focusing on demographic, housing, and social indicators.  
- Applied **unsupervised clustering methods** — including **K-Means and DBSCAN** — to group districts based on solitary-death risk and identify high-risk urban zones.  
- Performed **correlation analysis** between socioeconomic variables (e.g., age, housing type, welfare access) and mortality risk indices.  
- Proposed **policy recommendations** to the Seoul Metropolitan Government for mitigating isolation risks among elderly single-person households.
- **Submitted to the 2025 Seoul Data Hub Visualization Competition**, demonstrating the application of data-driven methods for social policy analysis.
