## 📂 Research Themes  
My research contributions align with three primary themes:
  
1. **Efficient NLP and Large Language Models** — Developing and fine-tuning models for dialogue generation, classification, and multilingual tasks, with a focus on model compression, parameter-efficient adaptation, and deployment in low-resource environments.
  
2. **AI for Social Impact and Responsible System**s — Applying machine learning to domains such as ESG-based credit scoring, sustainable finance, and public-facing AI services, demonstrating how data-driven systems can support fairness, accessibility, and real-world decision-making.
  
3. **Computational Humanities and Cross-disciplinary AI** — Bridging linguistics, NLP, and digital humanities through projects such as Shakespeare corpus analysis and language-driven cultural exploration, showing how computational approaches can extend traditional humanities research.
  
Collectively, these themes reflect my goal of building efficient, human-centered, and socially meaningful NLP systems.
