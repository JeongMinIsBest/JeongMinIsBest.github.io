## ðŸŒ  Introduction
I am an **AI Research Trainee at Aiffel Research 14th, Modulabs**. My work focuses on **Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs).**
<br/>
<br/>

## ðŸ”¬ Research Interests
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Machine Translation (MT)  
- Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- Applied AI for Multilingual Systems  
<br/>
<br/>

## ðŸ“‘ Research Overview
My research interests lie in **Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs)**, with a particular focus on **Machine Translation** and **applied NLP systems**.
  
I have worked on several projects and competitions, including the development of data-driven models for **ESG credit scoring**, **chatbot dialogue systems**, and **multilingual text analysis**.
  
Through these experiences, I gained hands-on expertise in machine learning techniques such as **XGBoost, CatBoost, and Transformer-based architectures**, as well as practical knowledge in data preprocessing, clustering, and evaluation.  
  
Looking ahead, my goal is to advance research in **NLP and multilingual language models**, and to build AI systems that not only achieve high performance but also contribute to solving **real-world challenges**.
