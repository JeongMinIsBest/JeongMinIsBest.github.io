## ðŸŒ  Introduction
I am a AI Research Trainee at Aiffel Research 14th, Modulabs.
My work focuses on **Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs).**



## ðŸ”¬ Research Interests
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Machine Translation (MT)  
- Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- Applied AI for Multilingual Systems  



## ðŸ“‘ Research Overview
My research interests lie in **Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs)**, 
with a particular focus on **Machine Translation** and **applied NLP systems**.  

I have worked on several projects and competitions, including the development of data-driven models for 
**ESG credit scoring**, **chatbot dialogue systems**, and **multilingual text analysis**.  
Through these experiences, I gained hands-on expertise in machine learning techniques such as **XGBoost, CatBoost, and Transformer-based architectures**, 
as well as practical knowledge in data preprocessing, clustering, and evaluation.  

Looking ahead, my goal is to advance research in **NLP and multilingual language models**, 
and to build AI systems that not only achieve high performance but also contribute to solving **real-world challenges**.



## ðŸŽ¯ Long-term Goals
My long-term goal is to:  
- Advance the state of research in **NLP, Machine Translation, and LLMs**  
- Develop **AI-driven solutions** that can bridge language barriers  
- Contribute to both academia and industry by delivering impactful and applicable AI systems
