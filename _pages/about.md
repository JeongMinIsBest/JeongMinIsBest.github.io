## 🌠 Introduction
I am an **AI Research Trainee at Aiffel Research 14th, Modulabs**. My work focuses on **Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs).**
<br/>
<br/>

## 🔬 Research Interests
- Efficient multilingual representation learning for low-resource languages, including machine translation  
- Lightweight pretraining and fine-tuning methods for large language models (LLMs)  
- Enhancing reliability and factual consistency of dialogue systems for socially beneficial applications   
<br/>
<br/>

## 📑 Research Overview
My research interests lie in **Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs)**, with a particular focus on **efficient multilingual representation learning for low-resource languages, including machine translation**, as well as **lightweight pretraining and reliable dialogue systems**.  

I have worked on several projects and competitions, including the development of data-driven models for **ESG credit scoring**, **chatbot dialogue systems with emotion analysis**, and **multilingual text analysis**.  

Through these experiences, I gained hands-on expertise in machine learning techniques such as **XGBoost, CatBoost, and Transformer-based architectures**, as well as practical knowledge in **data preprocessing, clustering, and evaluation**.  

Looking ahead, my goal is to advance research in **efficient and trustworthy multilingual NLP systems**, and to build AI models that not only achieve high performance but also contribute to solving **real-world challenges with reliability and social impact**.
